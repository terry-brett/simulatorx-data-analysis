name: Analysing the impact of age, gender and ethnicity on the spread of viruses
description: "Data driven approach to analyse the impact of biological cues, namely
  age, gender and ethnicity on the infection and recovery rates, with the use of compartmental
  modelling. We use COVID-19 as use case, due to the large amount of data currently
  available.\n\nUsing NetworkX we create a graph which reflects population, based
  on demographics from the data available from UK census, by setting attributes to
  each node, and then we run SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) simulations on
  it. We then compare our results with the official figures provided by the UK government
  on the infections in the given population.\n\nWe compute infection rate based on
  currently available COVID-19 data, and infect each nodes based on its individual
  attributes. \n\nIn addition to that we use VGG16 model to develop facial recognition
  system. This extracts age, gender and ethnicity from images, and creates a graph
  with those attributes. Similarly we use the generated graph to then perform an SIS
  simulation and again we compare our results with the official figures."
